Designers in neuromorphic engineering aim to construct electronic systems with the same efficient style of computation. This task requires a melding of novel engineering principles with knowledge gleaned from neuroscience. We discuss recent progress in realizing neuromorphic sensory systems which mimic the biological retina and cochlea, and subsequent sensor processing. The main trends are the increasing number of sensors and sensory systems that communicate through asynchronous digital signals analogous to neural spikes; the improved performance and usability of these sensors; and novel sensory processing methods which capitalize on the timing of spikes from these sensors. Experiments using these sensors can impact how we think the brain processes sensory information.},

This tiny outpost of the central nervous system is responsible for collecting all the visual information that reaches the brain. Signals from the retina must carry reliable information about properties of objects in the world over many orders of magnitude of illumination. Furthermore, these signals are generated by transducers whose characteristics are innately mismatched and must be continuously self-calibrated. Some of the mechanisms by which the retina achieves this feat are embodied in a two-dimensional {CMOS} chip, the silicon retina.},

	abstract = {Conventional vision, auditory, and olfactory sensors generate large volumes of redundant data and as a result tend to consume excessive power. To address these shortcomings, neuromorphic sensors have been developed. These sensors mimic the neuro-biological architecture of sensory organs using {aVLSI} (analog Very Large Scale Integration) and generate asynchronous spiking output that represents sensing information in ways that are similar to neural signals. This allows for much lower power consumption due to an ability to extract useful sensory information from sparse captured data. The foundation for research in neuromorphic sensors was laid more than two decades ago, but recent developments in understanding of biological sensing and advanced electronics, have stimulated research on sophisticated neuromorphic sensors that provide numerous advantages over conventional sensors. In this paper, we review the current state-of-the-art in neuromorphic implementation of vision, auditory, and olfactory sensors and identify key contributions across these fields. Bringing together these key contributions we suggest a future research direction for further development of the neuromorphic sensing field.},

The so augmented device is sensitive to mechanical stress. In combination with an analogue circuit, this sensor unit is capable of encoding the mechanical quantity into a series of spikes with an ongoing adaptation of the output frequency. This allows for a broad application in the context of robotic and neuromorphic systems, since it enables said systems to receive information from the surrounding environment and provide encoded spike trains for neuromorphic hardware.

Modeling the cochlea's micromechanics, including outer hair cell ({OHC}) electromotility, this silicon (Si) cochlea features active coupling between neighboring basilar membrane ({BM}) segments-a first. Neighboring {BM} segments, each implemented as a class {AB} log-domain second-order section, exchange currents representing {OHC} forces. This novel active-coupling architecture overcomes the major shortcomings of existing cascade and parallel filter-bank architectures, while achieving the highest number of digital outputs in an Si cochlea to date. An active-coupling architecture Si cochlea with 360 frequency channels and 2160 pulse-stream outputs occupies 10.9 mm2 in a five-metal 1-poly 0.25-mum {CMOS} process. The chip's responses resemble that of a living cochlea's: Frequency responses become larger and more sharply tuned when active coupling is turned on. For instance, gain increases by 18 {dB} and Q 10 increases from 0.45 to 1.14. This enhancement decreases with increasing input intensity, realizing frequency-selective automatic gain control.

Naturalistic textures were evaluated with a passive touch protocol. The resulting neuromorphic spike trains were able to classify ten naturalistic textures ranging from textiles to glass to {BioSkin}, with accuracy as high as 97\%. Remarkably, rather than on firing rate features calculated over the stimulation window, the highest achieved decoding performance was based on the precise spike timing of the neuromorphic output as captured by Victor Purpura distance. We also systematically varied the sliding velocity and the contact force to investigate the role of sensing conditions in categorizing the stimuli via the artificial sensory system. We found that the decoding performance based on the timing of neuromorphic spike events was robust for a broad range of sensing conditions. Being able to categorize naturalistic textures in different sensing conditions, these neurorobotic results pave the way to the use of neuromorphic tactile sensors in future real-life neuroprosthetic applications.},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art image sensors suffer from significant limitations imposed by their very principle of operation. These sensors acquire the visual information as a series of “snapshot” images, recorded at discrete points in time. Visual information gets time quantized at a predetermined frame rate which has no relation to the dynamics present in the scene. Furthermore, each recorded frame conveys the information from all pixels, regardless of whether this information, or a part of it, has changed since the last frame had been acquired. This acquisition method limits the temporal resolution, potentially missing important information, and leads to redundancy in the recorded image data, unnecessarily inflating data rate and volume. Biology is leading the way to a more efficient style of image acquisition. Biological vision systems are driven by events happening within the scene in view, and not, like image sensors, by artificially created timing and control signals. Translating the frameless paradigm of biological vision to artificial imaging systems implies that control over the acquisition of visual information is no longer being imposed externally to an array of pixels but the decision making is transferred to the single pixel that handles its own information individually. In this paper, recent developments in bioinspired, neuromorphic optical sensing and artificial vision are presented and discussed. It is suggested that bioinspired vision systems have the potential to outperform conventional, frame-based vision systems in many application fields and to establish new benchmarks in terms of redundancy suppression and data compression, dynamic range, temporal resolution, and power efficiency. Demanding vision tasks such as real-time 3-D mapping, complex multiobject tracking, or fast visual feedback loops for sensory-motor action, tasks that often pose severe, sometimes insurmountable, challenges to conventional artificial vision systems, are in reach using bioinspired vision sensing and processing techniques.},

The proposed gas recognition circuit examines the generated spike pattern of relative excitations across the population of sensors and looks for a match within a library of 2-D spatio-temporal spike signatures. Each signature is drift insensitive, concentration invariant and is also a unique characteristic of the target gas. This {VLSI} friendly approach relies on a simple spatio-temporal code matching instead of existing computationally expensive pattern matching statistical techniques. In addition, it relies on a novel sensor calibration technique that does not require control or prior knowledge of the gas concentration. The proposed gas recognition circuit was implemented in a 0.35 μm {CMOS} process and characterized using an in-house fabricated 4 × 4 tin oxide gas sensor array.

This study designed and fabricated an E-Nose signal-processing chip by using {TSMC} 0.18-μ m 1P6M complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology to overcome the need to connect the device to a personal computer, which has traditionally been a major stumbling block in reducing the size of E-Nose systems. The proposed chip is based on a conductive polymer sensor array chip composed of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The signal-processing chip comprises an interface circuit, an analog-to-digital converter, a memory module, and a microprocessor embedded with a pattern-recognition algorithm. Experimental results have verified the functionality of the proposed system, in which the E-Nose signal-processing chip successfully classified three odors, carbon tetrachloride ({CCl}4), chloroform ({CHCl}3), and 2-Butanone ({MEK}), demonstrating its potential for portable applications. The power consumption of this signal-processing chip was maintained at a very low 2.81 {mW} using a 1.8-V power supply, making it highly suitable for integration as an electronic nose system-on-chip.},

	abstract = {The biomimetic {CMOS} dynamic vision and image sensor described in this paper is based on a {QVGA} (304×240) array of fully autonomous pixels containing event-based change detection and pulse-width-modulation ({PWM}) imaging circuitry. Exposure measurements are initiated and carried out locally by the individual pixel that has detected a change of brightness in its field-of-view. Pixels do not rely on external timing signals and independently and asynchronously request access to an (asynchronous arbitrated) output channel when they have new grayscale values to communicate. Pixels that are not stimulated visually do not produce output. The visual information acquired from the scene, temporal contrast and grayscale data, are communicated in the form of asynchronous address-events ({AER}), with the grayscale values being encoded in inter-event intervals. The pixel-autonomous and massively parallel operation ideally results in lossless video compression through complete temporal redundancy suppression at the pixel level. Compression factors depend on scene activity and peak at 1000 for static scenes. Due to the time-based encoding of the illumination information, very high dynamic range - intra-scene {DR} of 143 {dB} static and 125 {dB} at 30 fps equivalent temporal resolution - is achieved. A novel time-domain correlated double sampling ({TCDS}) method yields array {FPN} of {\textless};0.25\% rms. {SNR} is {\textgreater}56 {dB} (9.3 bit) for {\textgreater}10 Lx illuminance.},

	abstract = {Modern gas sensor technology is becoming an important part of our lives. It has been applied within the home (monitoring {CO} levels from boilers), the workplace (e.g., checking levels of toxic gases) to healthcare (monitoring gases in hospitals). However, historically the high price of gas sensors has limited market penetration to niche applications, such as safety in mines or petrochemical plants. The high price may be attributed to several different components: (1) cost of a predominantly manual manufacturing process; (2) need for interface circuitry in the form of discrete components on a {PCB}; and (3) fireproof packaging, making the cost of gas detection instruments typically many hundreds of dollars. Consequently, there has been a considerable effort over the past 20 years, towards the goal of low-cost (\$1-\$5) gas sensors, employing modern microelectronics technology to manufacture both the sensing element and the signal conditioning circuitry on a single silicon chip. In this paper, we review the emerging field of {CMOS} gas sensors and focus upon the integration of two main gas-sensing principles, namely, resistive and electrochemical and associated circuitry by {CMOS} technology. We believe that the combination of {CMOS} technology with more recent {MEMS} processing is now mature enough to deliver the exacting demands required to make low-power, low-cost smart gas sensors in high volume and this should result in a new generation of {CMOS} gas sensors. These new integrated, mass-produced gas sensors could open up mass markets and affect our everyday lives through application in cars, cell phones, watches, etc.},

Touch sensor signals were simulated with a virtual hand model ({MuJoCo} {HAPTIX}) and were converted to a biological representation of tactile afferent spiking activity using existing neuron models ({TouchSim}). We simulated virtual hand object interaction, at three different movement speeds, and found that biomimetic tactile signals yield better results (91\%) compared to using traditional force signals (61\%) at classifying the different hand speeds. This software toolkit enables researchers to quickly generate, capture, and analyze biologically realistic tactile behavior for creating smarter and more effective robotic systems.},
